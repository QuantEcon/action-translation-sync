# Scientific Computing

## Code Examples

Here are some code examples.

```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

More explanation here.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2], 'b': [3, 4]})
```

## Mathematical Foundations

Key equations in this field.

$$
E = mc^2
$$

The famous equation above.

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

## Summary

Wrapping up the concepts.

```python
print("Done!")
```
