## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Persian (Farsi) Language Support**: Added full Persian language configuration
  - Persian (`fa`) language config with RTL punctuation rules
  - Language-specific prompt customization (formal/academic style)
  - Optimized token expansion factor (1.8x) for verbose RTL translations
- **Smart Token Management**: Hybrid pre-flight validation approach
  - Pre-flight size checks before translation (fail fast for oversized docs)
  - Always use API max tokens (32K) for translatable documents
  - Language-aware output token estimation (Persian: 1.8x, CJK: 1.3x, default: 1.5x)
  - Clear error messages for documents exceeding API limits
- **Improved Retry Logic**: Skip retries for permanent failures
  - Detects "document too large" and "truncated" errors
  - No wasted API calls on documents that can't be fixed by retry
  - Still retries transient errors (network, rate limits) with exponential backoff
- **Incomplete Document Detection**: Validates translation completeness
  - Marker-based detection of truncated translations
  - Directive block balance validation in prompts

### Changed
- **Bulk Translator Improvements**:
  - Always fetch `_toc.yml` from GitHub (consistent behavior in all modes)
  - Use `parseSections()` for heading-map generation (more lenient than `parseDocumentComponents()`)
  - Updated cost estimation to be model-aware (Sonnet/Opus/Haiku pricing)
  - Improved README with accurate costs and troubleshooting
  - Better token/cost reporting in translation summary
- **Translation Prompt Enhancements**:
  - Added directive block balancing rules (exercise-start/end, solution-start/end)
  - More explicit instructions for complete document translation
  - Language-specific expansion factors for better token estimates

### Fixed
- **Token Limit Issues**: Resolved truncation problems in bulk translation
  - Increased max_tokens from 8K to 32K for full documents
  - Pre-flight validation prevents wasted API calls on oversized docs
  - Improved Persian token estimation (1.6x → 1.8x)

## [0.6.3] - 2025-12-04

### Fixed
- **Test Data Syntax Errors**: Fixed 2 markdown syntax bugs in test fixtures
  - `19-multi-file-lecture.md`: Fixed malformed heading `####Applications` → `#### Applications`
  - `23-special-chars-lecture.md`: Fixed mixed fence markers `$$...``` ` → `$$...$$`
  - These were the exact errors v0.6.2's validation was designed to prevent!

### Changed
- **PR Labels Default**: Simplified from `translation-sync,automated` to `action-translation-sync,automated`
  - Removed redundant `translation-sync` label in favor of more specific `action-translation-sync`
  - Cleaned up hardcoded label duplication in index.ts
  - Labels now sourced solely from `pr-labels` input + source PR labels

## [0.6.2] - 2025-12-04

### Added
- **Enhanced Fence Marker Validation**: Translator now explicitly prevents mixing fence markers
  - Prevents mixing `$$` with ` ``` ` in math blocks (e.g., `$$...````)
  - Enforces consistency: use `$$...$$` OR ` ```{math}...``` `, never mixed
  - Added to all translation modes (UPDATE, NEW, FULL DOCUMENT)
  - Catches common syntax errors before they reach the evaluator
- **Improved Target PR Metadata**: Translation PRs now have better titles and labels
  - Title format: `🌐 [translation-sync] <source PR title>` (mirrors source PR)
  - Automatic labels: `automated`, `action-translation-sync`
  - Copies labels from source PR (except `test-translation`)
  - Makes translation PRs easier to identify and manage
- **Evaluator Model Selection**: New `--model` flag to choose evaluation model
  - Default: `claude-opus-4-5-20251101` (highest quality, $0.30/PR)
  - Alternative: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` (faster, cheaper $0.06/PR)
  - Enables cost/quality comparison for evaluation tasks

### Fixed
- **Evaluator: Renamed File Handling**: Fixed evaluation of renamed files
  - Now fetches "before" content from `previousFilename` field
  - Detects pure renames (no content changes) and marks appropriately
  - Prevents showing all sections as "changed" in rename-only PRs
- **Evaluator: Issue Normalization**: Improved parsing of Claude responses
  - Handles object-style issues with `description`, `location`, `suggestion` fields
  - Better fallback to JSON.stringify for unknown structures
  - Filters out empty/malformed issue strings

### Removed
- **Evaluator: `--dry-run` Flag**: Removed redundant flag
  - Use `npm run evaluate` to save reports (default behavior)
  - Use `npm run evaluate:post` to post reviews to PRs
  - Simpler CLI with clearer intent

## [0.6.1] - 2025-12-04

### Added
- **Markdown Syntax Validation in Prompts**: LLM-based syntax checking
  - Translator prompts (UPDATE, NEW, FULL DOCUMENT) now include explicit syntax rules
  - Evaluator includes "Syntax" as 5th evaluation criterion
  - `syntaxErrors` array in evaluation response for critical markdown errors
  - Syntax errors displayed prominently in PR comments with 🔴 markers
  - Rules: space after `#` in headings, matching code/math delimiters
- **Configurable Max Suggestions**: Evaluator now supports `--max-suggestions` flag
  - Default increased from ~2 to 5 suggestions
  - Prompt explicitly allows 0 suggestions for excellent translations
- **Changed Sections Detection**: Evaluator focuses suggestions on modified content only
  - Computes changed sections by comparing before/after content
  - Supports preamble changes, additions, modifications, deletions
  - Deep nesting support (######), empty sections, special characters

### Fixed  
- **Evaluator**: Changed sections list no longer includes non-existent sections
- **File Rename Handling**: Renamed files now properly handled in translation sync
  - Previously: renamed files were added as new files, leaving orphaned translations
  - Now: existing translation is transferred to new filename, old file is deleted
  - Uses GitHub's `previous_filename` field for rename detection
  - Preserves heading-map and existing translations when files are renamed

### Changed
- **Glossary**: Added 2 game theory terms (357 total, was 355)
  - "folk theorem" → "无名氏定理"
  - "grim trigger strategy" → "冷酷策略"

### Documentation
- Created myst-lint project proposal: QuantEcon/meta#268
