# Introduction to Quantitative Economics

This lecture series provides a comprehensive introduction to quantitative economics using Python and modern computational methods.

## Getting Started

To begin with quantitative economics, you need to understand the basics of economic modeling.

We will cover fundamental concepts like supply and demand, optimization, and equilibrium.

## Economic Models

Economic models are simplified representations of economic processes. They help us understand complex systems by focusing on key relationships.

We use both theoretical and empirical approaches to build and test these models.

## Mathematical Example

Consider a simple optimization problem:

$$
\max_{x} f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 1
$$

The solution is found by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.

## Python Tools

We use several Python libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

These tools are essential for numerical computation and data analysis.

## Data Analysis

Economic data analysis requires understanding statistics and probability.

We will explore real-world datasets and apply econometric methods.

## Conclusion

This introduction sets the stage for more advanced topics in quantitative economics.
