# Introduction to Quantitative Economics

This lecture series provides an introduction to quantitative economics using Python.

## Getting Started

To begin with quantitative economics, you need to understand the basics of economic modeling.

We will cover fundamental concepts like supply and demand, optimization, and equilibrium.

## Mathematical Example

Consider a simple optimization problem:

$$
\max_{x} f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 1
$$

The solution can be found using calculus.

## Python Tools

We use several Python libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

These tools are essential for numerical computation.

## Data Analysis

Economic data analysis requires understanding statistics and probability.

We will explore real-world datasets and apply econometric methods.

## Conclusion

This introduction sets the stage for more advanced topics in quantitative economics.
