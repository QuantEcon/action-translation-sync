# Evaluation Reports

This folder contains quality evaluation reports for the `action-translation-sync` GitHub Action.

Reports are generated by:
1. **`npm run evaluate`** in `../evaluate/` - Uses Claude Opus 4.5 to assess translation and diff quality
2. **Manual reviews** - Periodic human evaluation of translation accuracy

## Report Format

Reports follow the naming convention: `evaluation-<source>-<date>.md`

Each report includes:
- **Summary**: Pass/warn/fail counts, average scores
- **Per-PR Assessments**: Individual evaluation of each PR pair
- **Scope Check**: Were only the correct files/sections modified?
- **Translation Quality**: Accuracy, fluency, terminology, formatting
- **Diff Quality**: Position correctness, structure preservation, heading-map updates

## Generating New Reports

```bash
cd ../evaluate

npm run evaluate              # Evaluate all open PR pairs
npm run evaluate -- --pr 123  # Evaluate specific source PR
npm run evaluate:dry-run      # Preview without posting reviews
```

Reports are automatically saved to this folder with the format `evaluation-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
