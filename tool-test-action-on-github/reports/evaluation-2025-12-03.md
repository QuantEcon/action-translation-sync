- **Verdict**: PASS

**Translation Summary**: Excellent translation quality with accurate terminology, natural flow, and perfect formatting preservation. The translation correctly handles the economics framework document, maintaining all section headings (both with and without content), following the established glossary for technical terms, and preserving the document's structural intent as a framework with placeholder sections. Minor improvements could be made to a few phrases for more idiomatic expression, but overall the translation is professional and publication-ready.

**Diff Summary**: Translation sync correctly transformed the document from a simple 3-section economics intro to a comprehensive 17-section framework with proper heading hierarchy and complete heading-map updates.
