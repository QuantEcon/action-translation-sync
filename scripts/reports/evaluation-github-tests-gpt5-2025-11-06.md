# Evaluation Report — GitHub Translation-Sync Tests (2025-11-06)

This report evaluates TARGET repository PRs generated by the action-translation-sync workflow against their SOURCE PRs, focusing on:
- Scope correctness: only relevant files/sections changed, correct structure (sections, heading-map, TOC)
- Translation quality: terminology, readability, MyST math/code integrity, and heading-map maintenance

All findings are based on inspection of PR conversations and “Files changed” diffs in:
- SOURCE: https://github.com/QuantEcon/test-translation-sync
- TARGET: https://github.com/QuantEcon/test-translation-sync.zh-cn

Date: 2025-11-06
Evaluator: Automated review via Copilot agent

## Summary
- PR pairs evaluated: 21 (TARGET #337–#357 inclusive)
- Scope check: PASS for all evaluated PRs
- Translation quality: PASS for all; a few minor stylistic nits (punctuation consistency)
- Terminology consistency: “列昂惕夫逆矩阵” standardized in newer updates
- MyST integrity: Code-cell fences, display math, labels, and frontmatter consistently preserved
- Heading-map maintenance: Correctly updated to reflect added/deleted/renamed sections at all depths

## Cross-cutting Observations

- Section-based sync behaves correctly across: additions, deletions, reorders, deep nesting, metadata-only changes, file rename, and multi-file scenarios.
- Heading-map is consistently updated for both sections and subsections, enabling position/ID-agnostic matching across languages.
- Math blocks: LaTeX preserved; labels retained. Display math updates correctly captured when SOURCE changes (e.g., membership conditions, nonzero vectors).
- Code cells: Comments/titles updated; code remains runnable (no syntax diffs introduced by translation).
- Punctuation/style: A few occurrences of ASCII punctuation in Chinese text; optional cleanup, not correctness-impacting.

## Recommendations

- Optional style pass: Normalize Chinese punctuation (full-width colons/commas) in narrative text for consistency.
- Continue standardizing domain terms via glossary (e.g., ensure “列昂惕夫” consistently used going forward).
- Keep regression tests around nested subsections and heading-map updates; these scenarios are well-covered and should remain guarded.

## Method

- Verified each TARGET PR body references the originating SOURCE PR and scenario.
- Inspected “Files changed” for scope and structure, with special attention to:
  - Frontmatter (heading-map, kernelspec)
  - MyST math/code fences and labels
  - Section and subsection hierarchy (##–######)
  - TOC updates when files were added/removed/renamed
- Evaluations recorded here as PASS/notes; no blocking issues found in this batch.
