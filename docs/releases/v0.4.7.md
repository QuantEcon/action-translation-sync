# Release v0.4.7 - Full Recursive Heading Support

**Release Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: Production-Ready ✅  
**Type**: Critical Bug Fix + Enhancement

---

## Overview

v0.4.7 implements full recursive heading support for all MyST Markdown heading levels (##, ###, ####, #####, ######), fixing a critical bug where changes to sub-subsections and deeper nesting were not detected, causing incomplete translations.

**Critical Fix**: GitHub Test 10 revealed that adding a `#### Closure Property` sub-subsection to a `### Basic Properties` subsection was not detected, resulting in no translation. This release completely resolves the issue with a robust recursive solution.

---

## The Problem

### Symptoms
- Changes to `####` (sub-subsections) and deeper levels were silently ignored
- Diff detector reported `UNCHANGED` even when content was added
- Translations incomplete for documents with nested structure
- Test 10 failed: sub-subsection addition not detected

### Root Cause
1. **Parser**: Only handled `##` (sections) and `###` (subsections) explicitly
2. **Diff Detector**: Only compared section-level content, ignoring nested subsections recursively
3. **Result**: Changes within `###` subsections were not propagated to parent section comparison

Example failure:
```markdown
## Vector Spaces
  ### Basic Properties
    #### Applications in Economics  (already exists)
    #### Closure Property          (NEW - added) ❌ Not detected!
```

---

## The Solution

### 1. Parser Refactoring (src/parser.ts)

**Before** - Hardcoded levels:
```typescript
// Check for ## heading
const h2Match = line.match(/^##\s+(.+)$/);
if (h2Match) { ... }

// Check for ### heading  
const h3Match = line.match(/^###\s+(.+)$/);
if (h3Match) { ... }
```

**After** - Stack-based recursion:
```typescript
// Check for any heading level (## through ######)
const headingMatch = line.match(/^(#{2,6})\s+(.+)$/);
if (headingMatch) {
  const level = headingMatch[1].length;  // 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
  // Stack-based handling for arbitrary depth
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Handles all MyST heading levels (2-6)
- Arbitrary nesting depth supported
- Truly recursive `Section.subsections` structure
- ~80 lines of code (down from ~120)

### 2. Diff Detector Enhancement (src/diff-detector.ts)

**Before** - Flat comparison:
```typescript
private sectionContentEqual(s1: Section, s2: Section): boolean {
  return s1.content.trim() === s2.content.trim();
}
```

**After** - Recursive comparison:
```typescript
private sectionContentEqual(s1: Section, s2: Section): boolean {
  // 1. Compare direct content
  if (s1.content.trim() !== s2.content.trim()) return false;
  
  // 2. Compare subsection count
  if (s1.subsections.length !== s2.subsections.length) return false;
  
  // 3. Recursively compare each subsection
  for (let i = 0; i < s1.subsections.length; i++) {
    if (!this.sectionContentEqual(s1.subsections[i], s2.subsections[i])) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Detects changes at any nesting depth
- Count and content comparison at each level
- Handles arbitrarily nested structures

### 3. File Processor Fixes (src/file-processor.ts)

**Issue**: When sections were modified and translated, the heading from the translation (English in TEST mode) was used instead of preserving the Chinese heading from the target.

**Fix**:
```typescript
// Extract heading from target section (Chinese) and body from translated content
let finalContent = contentWithoutSubsections || targetSection.content;
if (contentWithoutSubsections) {
  const translatedLines = contentWithoutSubsections.split('\n');
  const bodyLines = translatedLines.slice(1);  // Skip translated heading
  finalContent = `${targetSection.heading}\n${bodyLines.join('\n')}`;  // Use target heading!
}

// Preserve target subsections if translator doesn't return full structure (TEST mode)
const finalSubsections = subsections.length > 0 ? subsections : targetSection.subsections;
```

## What's New

### Features
✅ **Full Recursive Parsing**: All heading levels (##-######) supported with arbitrary nesting  
✅ **Recursive Change Detection**: Detects modifications at any depth  
✅ **Preserved Target Headings**: Chinese headings maintained during translation updates  
✅ **Preserved Target Subsections**: Subsection structure maintained when translator returns simplified content

### Test Coverage
✅ **6 New Tests** for nested subsection detection:
- `should detect #### sub-subsection added to ### subsection`
- `should detect #### content modification within ### subsection`
- `should detect ##### deeply nested changes`
- `should detect multiple #### subsections added`
- `should handle mixed depth changes (#### added, ### modified)`
- `should NOT detect change when #### content unchanged`

✅ **Total**: 131 tests passing (125 original + 6 new)

### GitHub Validation
✅ **Test 10** now passes:
```
[DiffDetector] MODIFIED: Section "## Vector Spaces"
[DiffDetector] Total section changes detected: 1
[Translator] Translating section update, mode=update
Created PR: https://github.com/QuantEcon/test-translation-sync.zh-cn/pull/193
```

## Technical Details

### Parser Algorithm

**Stack-Based Approach**:
1. Maintain stack of currently open sections at each level
2. When new heading encountered:
   - Pop stack until parent level found
   - Push completed sections to their parents
   - Push new section onto stack
3. At end, unwind stack to complete all sections

**Advantages**:
- O(n) time complexity (single pass)
- O(d) space complexity where d = max depth
- Naturally handles arbitrary nesting
- No recursion in parsing (just in structure)

### Comparison Algorithm

**Recursive Descent**:
1. Compare direct content (without subsections)
2. Check subsection counts match
3. Recursively compare each subsection pair
4. Short-circuit on first difference

**Advantages**:
- Detects changes at any depth
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to reason about
- Efficient (stops at first diff)

## Migration Guide

**No Breaking Changes** - This release is fully backward compatible.

### For Users

- Deeply nested structures now fully supported
- More accurate translations for complex documents

### For Developers
- Parser API unchanged
- `Section` interface unchanged (already had recursive `subsections`)
- Diff detector API unchanged
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Additional Fixes

### Recursive serializeSection (76c0368)
**Problem**: `serializeSection` only wrote `subsection.content` directly, losing nested subsections during reconstruction.

**Fix**: Made `serializeSection` fully recursive:
```typescript
for (const subsection of section.subsections) {
  parts.push('');
  parts.push(this.serializeSection(subsection));  // Recursive!
}
```

### Subsection Count Validation (17a3b87)
**Problem**: When translating MODIFIED sections, parsed subsections from Claude might be incomplete (e.g., 1 of 2 expected), causing data loss.

**Fix**: Compare parsed subsection count with expected count from source:
```typescript
const expectedSubsectionCount = newSection.subsections.length;
const parsedSubsectionCount = subsections.length;

if (parsedSubsectionCount === expectedSubsectionCount && parsedSubsectionCount > 0) {
  finalSubsections = subsections;  // Use translated
} else {
  finalSubsections = targetSection.subsections;  // Preserve to avoid data loss
}
```

### Title Preservation in heading-map (fba6013)
**Problem**: `updateHeadingMap` deleted title entries because it only tracked section headings in `currentSourceHeadings`.

**Fix**: Added optional `titleHeading` parameter to preserve titles:
```typescript
export function updateHeadingMap(
  existingMap: HeadingMap,
  sourceSections: Section[],
  targetSections: Section[],
  titleHeading?: string  // Preserve this heading
): HeadingMap
```

**Tests Added** (+2):
- `should preserve title in heading-map when provided`
- `should handle title changes correctly`

### heading-map Document Order (ce6bd3a)
**Problem**: heading-map entries were out of order due to Map insertion order being preserved from old map.

**Fix**: Build new Map in document order (title first, then sections):
```typescript
const updated = new Map<string, string>();

if (titleHeading) {
  const titleTranslation = existingMap.get(titleHeading);
  if (titleTranslation) {
    updated.set(titleHeading, titleTranslation);  // Title first!
  }
}
// Then add sections in document order...
```
