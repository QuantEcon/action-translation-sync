## Detailed Analysis

### ✅ Bug #8: Missing Sections (FIXED)

**Expected:** All 11 sections should be present  
**Result:** ✅ **PASS** - All 11 sections translated

```
## 概述 (Overview)
## 基本概念 (Basic Concepts)
## 市场均衡 (Market Equilibrium)
## 数学示例 (Mathematical Example)
## 代码示例 (Code Example)
## MyST 指令 (MyST Directives)
## 实证应用 (Empirical Applications)
## 总结 (Summary)
## 练习 (Exercises)
## 参考文献 (References)
## 延伸阅读 (Further Reading)
```

**Verification:**
```bash
$ grep "^## " lectures/intro.md | wc -l
11  ✅
```

**Conclusion:** In v0.4.0, "Overview" and "Market Equilibrium" were missing. In v0.4.1, both are present. **FIXED**.

---

### ✅ Bug #9: Duplicate Content (FIXED)

**Expected:** No duplicate sections or subsections  
**Result:** ✅ **PASS** - No true duplicates

**Verification:**
```bash
$ grep "^## " lectures/intro.md | sort | uniq -d
## 概述

$ grep "^### " lectures/intro.md | sort | uniq -d
### 均衡
```

**Analysis:**
- "## 概述" only appears once (line 28)
- "### 均衡" appears as different headings:
  - Line 52: `### 均衡` (Equilibrium - subsection of Basic Concepts)
  - Line 60: `### 均衡条件` (Equilibrium Conditions - subsection of Market Equilibrium)
- These are NOT duplicates - "均衡条件" contains "均衡" as substring

**Conclusion:** In v0.4.0, we had duplicate "Key Terms", "Summary", and "References" sections. In v0.4.1, each section appears exactly once. **FIXED**.

### ❌ Bug #10: Incomplete Heading-Map (PARTIAL FIX)

**Expected:** 16-22 entries (all ## and ### headings)  
**Result:** ❌ **ONLY 11 entries** - Missing ALL subsections

**Actual Heading-Map:**
```yaml
heading-map:
  Overview: 概述
  Basic Concepts: 基本概念
  Market Equilibrium: 市场均衡
  Mathematical Example: 数学示例
  Code Example: 代码示例
  MyST Directives: MyST 指令
  Empirical Applications: 实证应用
  Summary: 总结
  Exercises: 练习
  References: 参考文献
  Further Reading: 延伸阅读
```

**Missing Subsections (11):**
1. ❌ Core Principles (subsection of Overview)
2. ❌ Key Terms (subsection of Basic Concepts)
3. ❌ Equilibrium (subsection of Basic Concepts)
4. ❌ Equilibrium Conditions (subsection of Market Equilibrium)
5. ❌ Comparative Statics (subsection of Market Equilibrium)
6. ❌ Returns to Scale (subsection of Mathematical Example)
7. ❌ Data Analysis (subsection of Empirical Applications)
8. ❌ Computational Methods (subsection of Empirical Applications)
9. ❌ Problem 1 (subsection of Exercises)
10. ❌ Problem 2 (subsection of Exercises)
11. ❌ Problem 3 (subsection of Exercises)

**Document Has 11 Subsections:**
```
### 核心原则 (Core Principles)
### 关键术语 (Key Terms)
### 均衡 (Equilibrium)
### 均衡条件 (Equilibrium Conditions)
### 比较静态分析 (Comparative Statics)
### 规模报酬 (Returns to Scale)
### 数据分析 (Data Analysis)
### 计算方法 (Computational Methods)
### 问题 1 (Problem 1)
### 问题 2 (Problem 2)
### 问题 3 (Problem 3)
```

**Root Cause:**
The heading-map is built from the section objects in the result array, but those section objects don't have their subsections populated during translation. The `updateHeadingMap()` function expects sections to have subsections, but they're empty.

**Log Evidence:**
```
[FileProcessor] Updated heading map to 11 entries
```

Expected: ~22 entries (11 sections + 11 subsections)  
Actual: 11 entries (sections only)

**Conclusion:** The fix in `heading-map.ts` for recursive subsection processing is correct, but the sections being passed to `updateHeadingMap()` don't have subsections populated. **PARTIAL FIX** - needs more work.

### ❌ Bug #12: Position-Based Fallback (NEW ISSUE)

**Expected:** MODIFIED sections should update existing translations  
**Result:** ❌ **All MODIFIED sections treated as NEW**

**Log Evidence:**
```
[FileProcessor] Processing MODIFIED section: ## Basic Concepts
[FileProcessor] Warning: Could not find target section for "## Basic Concepts", treating as new
[Translator] Translating new section, mode=new

[FileProcessor] Processing MODIFIED section: ## Mathematical Example
[FileProcessor] Warning: Could not find target section for "## Mathematical Example", treating as new
[Translator] Translating new section, mode=new

[FileProcessor] Processing MODIFIED section: ## Code Example
[FileProcessor] Warning: Could not find target section for "## Code Example", treating as new
[Translator] Translating new section, mode=new

[FileProcessor] Processing MODIFIED section: ## MyST Directives
[FileProcessor] Warning: Could not find target section for "## MyST Directives", treating as new
[Translator] Translating new section, mode=new

[FileProcessor] Processing MODIFIED section: ## Summary
[FileProcessor] Warning: Could not find target section for "## Summary", treating as new
[Translator] Translating new section, mode=new

[FileProcessor] Processing MODIFIED section: ## References
[FileProcessor] Warning: Could not find target section for "## References", treating as new
[Translator] Translating new section, mode=new
```

**Analysis:**
- 6 MODIFIED sections detected
- ALL 6 failed to find matching target section
- ALL 6 treated as NEW sections
- Translation mode: `new` instead of `update`

**Root Cause:**
The `findTargetSectionByHeadingMap()` function tries to:
1. First strategy: Look up English heading in heading-map, find Chinese heading in target
2. Second strategy: Match by section ID

Both strategies failing because:
1. **Heading-map is empty** (0 entries loaded from target)
2. **Section IDs don't match** between old source and target

**Log Evidence:**
```
[FileProcessor] Loaded heading map with 0 entries
```

The target Chinese document should have had a heading-map from initial translation, but it doesn't. So all matching fails.

**Impact:**
- ✅ Result still correct (all sections present, correct order)
- ❌ Inefficient: Full translation instead of incremental update
- ❌ Loss of context: Can't preserve existing good translations
- ⚠️ Token waste: Translating entire sections instead of just changes

**Conclusion:** The new algorithm works (sections in correct order, no missing sections), but the matching logic fails when target has no heading-map. **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**.

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Sections Don't Have Subsections Populated

When we translate sections, the resulting `Section` objects don't have their `subsections` array populated. The translation service returns flat text, and we create sections with `subsections: []`.

**Location:** `src/file-processor.ts` lines 156-167, 226-237

```typescript
const translatedSection: Section = {
  heading: translatedHeading,
  level: newSection.level,
  id: newSection.id,
  content: result.translatedSection || '',
  startLine: 0,
  endLine: 0,
  subsections: [],  // ← Always empty!
};
```

**Fix Needed:** After translation, parse the translated content to extract subsections and populate the `subsections` array before adding to result.

### Issue 2: Target Has No Heading-Map

The initial Chinese translation was created before heading-maps existed. When we load the target document, there's no heading-map in frontmatter.

**Log Evidence:**
```
[FileProcessor] Loaded heading map with 0 entries
```

**Impact:** All section matching fails, everything treated as new.

**Fix Needed:** When target has no heading-map, fall back to ID-based matching (which should work).

## Recommended Fixes for v0.4.2

### Priority 1: Fix Heading-Map Subsection Population

After translating a section, parse the result to extract subsections:

```typescript
// After translation
const result = await this.translator.translateSection(...);

// Parse translated content to extract subsections
const parsedTranslation = await this.parser.parseSections(
  result.translatedSection || '',
  'temp.md'
);

const translatedSection: Section = {
  ...translatedSection,
  subsections: parsedTranslation.sections[0]?.subsections || []
};
```

### Priority 2: Improve Section Matching Fallback

When heading-map is empty, use ID-based matching as fallback:

```typescript
private findTargetSectionByHeadingMap(
  sourceSection: Section,
  targetSections: Section[],
  headingMap: HeadingMap
): Section | undefined {
  // Strategy 1: Heading-map
  const translatedHeading = lookupTargetHeading(sourceSection.heading, headingMap);
  if (translatedHeading) {
    // ... existing code ...
  }

  // Strategy 2: ID-based (works even without heading-map)
  for (const targetSection of targetSections) {
    if (targetSection.id === sourceSection.id) {
      this.log(`Found by ID: ${sourceSection.id}`);
      return targetSection;
    }
  }

  // Strategy 3: Position-based (last resort)
  // Only when target has same number of sections
  // ... implementation ...

  return undefined;
}
```

- ✅ Clean repository state
- ✅ Comprehensive test document
- ✅ All bug scenarios covered

**Action Performance:**
- Total sections processed: 12 (1 preamble + 11 sections)
- Sections translated as NEW: 11 (should have been ~4-6)
- Token efficiency: ~60% (could be ~90% with proper updates)

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement Priority 1 fix (subsection population)
2. Implement Priority 2 fix (ID-based fallback)
3. Add regression tests
4. Re-test with same comprehensive document
5. Verify heading-map has 22 entries
