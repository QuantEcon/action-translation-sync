# Translation Sync Action - TODO

## Project Status

**Current Version**: v0.1.0 (Released!)  
**Repository**: https://github.com/quantecon/action-translation-sync  
**Target Version**: v1.0 (Production Ready)  
**Focus**: Testing with lecture-python.myst ‚Üí lecture-python.zh-cn

**Note**: We are NOT maintaining backward compatibility during v0.1.x development. Breaking changes are acceptable and expected as we iterate toward the best design.

## Completed ‚úÖ

### Step 1: Project Setup
- [x] Initialize npm package

- [x] Context extraction for blocks

### Step 3: Diff Detection Engine
- [x] Implement change detection (added/modified/deleted)
- [x] Structural block matching
- [x] Fuzzy content similarity matching
- [x] Block mapping to target document
- [x] Confidence scoring for matches

## In Progress üöß

### Step 4: Translation Service
- [x] Claude API integration
- [x] Diff mode prompt building
- [x] Full mode prompt building
- [x] Glossary formatting
- [ ] Error handling and retries
- [ ] Rate limiting

### Step 5: File Processing
- [x] Orchestrate diff-based translation
- [x] Orchestrate full file translation
- [x] Apply translations to target document
- [x] MyST validation
- [ ] TOC file parsing and updating

## Remaining Work üìù

### Step 6: GitHub Integration
- [ ] Clone target repository
- [ ] Create branch in target repo
- [ ] Commit translated files
- [ ] Create pull request
- [ ] Add PR description with source PR link
- [ ] Apply labels and reviewers
- [ ] Comment on source PR with target PR link

### Step 7: Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for parser
- [ ] Unit tests for diff detector
- [ ] Unit tests for translator (mocked)
- [ ] Unit tests for file processor
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] E2E test with sample repos

### Step 8: Documentation
- [x] README with usage instructions
- [x] Example workflow configurations
- [x] Glossary format documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Contributing guidelines

### Step 9: Initial Release
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create GitHub repository (quantecon/action-translation-sync)
- [x] Push code to GitHub
- [x] Create v0.1.0 tag
- [x] Create v0.1 floating tag
- [x] Publish release to GitHub
- [ ] Test with lecture-python.myst (next step)

### Step 10: CI/CD
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow for building
- [ ] Automated version tagging
- [ ] Dependabot configuration

### Step 11: Enhancements (Future)
- [ ] Support for multiple files in single PR
- [ ] Batch translation optimization
- [ ] Translation memory/caching
- [ ] Dry-run mode
- [ ] Custom prompt templates
- [ ] Translation quality metrics
- [ ] Issue creation on failure
- [ ] Notification system

## Known Issues üêõ

- GitHub PR integration not implemented (will fail at PR creation)
- TOC management not implemented
- Limited test coverage
- No error recovery for partial failures

## Notes üìî

- **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4.5-20241022)
- **Built-in Glossary**: 342 terms in glossary/zh-cn.json
- MyST parsing uses unified/remark ecosystem
- Type errors resolved by using `any` for visit callback (remark types are complex)
- Build successful with ncc bundling (2,452 KB)
- **v0.1.0 Released**: October 16, 2025
- Repository: https://github.com/quantecon/action-translation-sync
