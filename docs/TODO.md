# Translation Sync Action - TODO

## Project Status

**Current Version**: v0.3.0 (In Development)  
**Repository**: https://github.com/quantecon/action-translation-sync  
**Target Version**: v1.0 (Production Ready)  
**Focus**: Section-based approach with comprehensive testing

**Note**: We are NOT maintaining backward compatibility during v0.x development. Breaking changes are acceptable and expected as we iterate toward the best design.

## Recent Progress

### v0.3.0 Development
- ‚úÖ Complete section-based refactor (43% code reduction, 28% bundle reduction)
- ‚úÖ Claude Sonnet 4.5 integration (`claude-sonnet-4.5-20241022`)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (28 tests, all passing)
- ‚úÖ Bug #1 fixed: `sectionsMatch()` now requires ID match (commit 61095aa)
- ‚úÖ Bug #2 fixed: `findMatchingSectionIndex()` matches by ID (commit pending)
- üöß Testing with real translation PRs
- üöß Update STATUS-REPORT.md and release v0.3.0
